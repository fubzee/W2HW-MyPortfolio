            <h2>My Career</h2>

                <p>My career commenced in the IT department as a junior or entry level COBOL programmer and was eventually a
                        manager of a team of developers and analyst programmers where we were responsible for delivery of various
                        applications, I was fortunate to have been exposed to a number of initiatives that included the delivery of 
                        new systems and funcionality using the devlopment tools of the time and participated in major migration 
                        projects that included code and data conversions.  
                        
                        I then decided to focus my career on the merging role of the Business Systems Analyst (now known by many things)
                        and was eventually a Senior Systems Manager leading a team of business system's analysts - during my time was involved with a 
                        lot of key projects for my employers that saw me managing the changes across a range of systems supported 
                        by an in-house IT department and vendors.

                        In my current role as Solution Delivery Manager I am again focused more on the management of a techncial team
                         (Developers and Systems Analysts) and am amazed at the change (progress) in the development process in terms 
                         of what you can code (build), which has instilled a renewed desire to build out solutions using these latest 
                         technologies and techniques with source control and cloud computing and providing me with an opportunity 
                         to once again to tap into my creative side.  

                        My experience is skewed to towards banking within the FInancial Services Industry but for a brief time I was exposed to the
                        logistics of Cash Management and Superannuation (Wrap).
